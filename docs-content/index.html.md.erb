## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

[AppDynamics Platform Monitoring for Pivotal Platform (Pivotal Platform)](https://network.pivotal.io/products/appdynamics-platform/)
provides visibility into the Pivotal Platform platform where your AppDynamics-monitored applications are deployed.
The tile deploys a Firehose Nozzle that collects various KPI metrics and publishes them to a controller.
It also deploys a Dashboard App that automatically creates KPI health rules and custom dashboards associated
with the health rules, which can be used to monitor the health and capacity of one or more Pivotal Platform foundations.
