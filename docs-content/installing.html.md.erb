title: Installing and Configuring AppDynamics Platform Monitoring for Pivotal Platform
owner: Partners
---

This topic describes how to install and configure the **AppDynamics Platform Monitoring for Pivotal Platform** tile.
The tile allows you to deploy the AppDynamics Firehose Nozzle. The Firehose Nozzle collects various KPI metrics and a dashboard that
automatically creates health rules and custom dashboards associated with the collected metrics.

Additionally, the tile allows for advanced configuration to customize metric collection, configuring
multi-foundation dashboards and overiding default configurations.

<p class="note"><strong>Note: </strong>Starting with 5.x version of the AppDynamics Platform Monitoring for Pivotal Platform tile, the default AppDynamics Nozzle Configuration has been changed to include <strong>UUA User</strong> and <strong>UAA Secret</strong> fields. The 4.x fields: <strong>Doppler Logging Endpoint, Nozzle Username</strong> and <strong>Nozzle Password</strong> have been removed.</p>

## <a id='overview-appd-nozzle'></a> Overview

The tile deploys an AppDynamics Nozzle and Dashboard App as Pivotal Platform apps to the org and space appdynamics-org/appdynamics-space. The diagram illustrates the AppDynamics Nozzle that is deployed by the tile. The Nozzle aggregates and forwards metrics from the 
**Loggregator [Firehose](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/loggregator/architecture.html#firehose)** to
the AppDynamics Controller. The metrics are published in the Controller as custom metrics under the
default application name, appd-nozzle-v2, and tier that corresponds to the system domain of the Pivotal Platform
foundation.

The Dashboard App deployed by the tile will automatically create a set of KPI health rules and a Single Foundation Dashboard in the Controller configured in the Nozzle Configuration. These dashboards reflect the health and capacity of the foundation where the tile is installed.

![AppD Nozzle to Loggregator Firehose](./images/pcf-foundation-03.png)

In addition, based on optional configuration added in the tile under AppDynamics Dashboard Configuration, the Dashboard App will create one or more Multi-Foundation Dashboards. These dashboards summarize the health and capacity of multiple foundations, assuming each foundation has the AppDynamics Platform Monitoring for Pivotal Platform tile installed, and each tile is configured to report
to the same AppDynamics controller, as indicated in the diagram.

### <a id='Nozzle Credentials'></a> AppDynamics Nozzle Credentials

Depending on the version of the AppDynamics Platform Monitoring for Pivotal Platform tile, there are two options to authenticate a user:

*  v5.x Nozzle Credentials
*  v4.x Nozzle Credentials

#### v5.x Nozzle Credentials

Version 5.x of the AppDynamics Platform tile uses a **UAA User** and **UAA Secret** instead of a **Doppler Logging Endpoint, Username**, and **Password**.

To create a UAA User that can access the data, use the [UAA CLI](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/uaa/uaa-user-management.html).

1. Create the user:

    ```bash
    uaac target https://uaa.sys.<pcf system domain> --skip-ssl-validation
    uaac token client get admin -s <admin client secret>
    uaac client add my-v2-nozzle \
      --name my-v2-nozzle \
      --secret <my-v2-nozzle client secret> \
      --authorized_grant_types client_credentials,refresh_token \
      --authorities logs.admin
    ```

1. Manually get a token:

    ```bash
    uaac token client get v2-nozzle-test -s <my-v2-nozzle client secret>
    uaac context
    ```

    The RLP Gateway data can be tested with `curl`.

1. To view the data in the form of newline-delimited JSON payloads, copy the token and run:

    ```bash
    export token=<my-v2-nozzle token from context>
    curl -k -H "Authorization: $token" 'https://log-stream.sys.<pcf system domain>/v2/read?counter&gauge'
    ```

#### v4.x Nozzle Credentials

Cloud Foundry (CF) environments usually ship with an **opentsdb-firehose-nozzle** account which already belongs to the **doppler.firehose** group.
To use the existing **opentsdb-firehose-nozzle** account shipped with Cloud Foundry(CF):

1. Log in to the **OPS Manager** and select the **PAS** tile.
1. Navigate to **Credentials > UAA > Opentsdb Nozzle Credentials**.
1. Copy the username and password.

(or)

* Create a new account in the **doppler.firehose group** with the correct permissions.
For more information, see [UAA Client](https://github.com/cf-platform-eng/firehose-nozzle#option-2-uaa-client).

### <a id='dashboard configuration'></a> AppDynamics Dashboard Configuration

This form receives information to create a Dashboard and associated health rules on the AppDynamics Controller

![Settings tab for AppDynamics Dashboard Configuration](./images/dashboard_config.png)

* **Username for Reporting Custom Dashboard**: Username of an account with custom dashboard creation permissions.
* **Password**: Password for the Controller account.

Refer this section for setting up a [controller account with required permissions](kpi_dashboard.html#dashboard-app)

#### <a id='configuration'></a> Multi-foundation Dashboard Configuration (Optional)

The Multi-foundation Dashboard Configuration supports creating a single dashboard that displays the health and performance of multiple foundations. Each foundation that is included must have the platform tile installed and the Nozzle configured to report to the same Controller.

One Multi-foundation Dashboard is created for each configuration added in the Multi-foundation Dashboard Configurations section. In the example below, ‘all-foundations’ is the name of the new configuration, and will be prepended to the name of the dashboard created in the Controller, which uses the format &lt;config name&gt;-PCF Multi-foundation Dashboard.

![](./images/08multidashboardconfig.png)

The ‘Application regex’ and ‘Tier regex’ should match one or more app/tier combinations where AppDynamics Nozzles are reporting. Based on the default app and tier, the example uses ‘appd-nozzle-v2’ as the app regex, and sys.* as the tier regex, which will match any system domain.

The ‘Dashboard layout selection’ defaults to ‘Auto select layout’ where the Dashboard App selects a layout with the appropriate number of foundations per row based on the total number of foundations discovered. Or a specific layout can be chosen to control the density of the created dashboard.

Below are examples of the ‘Two foundations per row’ and ‘Four foundations per row’ layouts.

![Four foundations per row layout](./images/09fourfoundation.png)

![Two foundations per row layout](./images/10twofoundation.png)

### <a id='Advanced metrics collection'></a> (Optional) Extending Metrics Collection

Starting with the 4.6.* version of the tile we have included a feature to collect additional metrics in addition to
the default standard KPI metrics that are collected by AppDynamics Nozzle.

![Settings tab for AppDynamics Advanced Metrics](./images/advanced_metrics.png)

* **Collect Container Metrics**: Check this box to collect Container metrics for the applications.

* **Extended Metrics JSON Filter**: AppDynamics Nozzle aplies a filter to limit the number of metrics that are processed. This JSON configures
the filter. It is a simple JSON dictionary with metrics `origin` tag used as keys and the list of `names` of metrics that belong to the `origin` that are to be collected as value.
Additionally, a wildcard `"*"` can also be used inside the list to collect all metrics under the `origin`.

```json
{
    "<origin>":["<MetricName1>", "<MetricName2>"],
    "<origin>":["*"]
}
```

e.g: Consider this metric with `origin` set to `uaa` with `name` `audit_service.principal_not_found_count`

```bash
origin:"uaa" eventType:ValueMetric timestamp:1553201379027067175 deployment:"cf" job:"uaa" index:"1e586719-7e22-4cb4-944d-2176db9e01b8"
 ip:"192.168.16.21" tags:<key:"source_id" value:"uaa" >
 valueMetric:<name:"audit_service.principal_not_found_count" value:0 unit:"gauge" >
```
to report the metric the filter entry will be

```json
{
    "uaa": ["audit_service.principal_not_found_count"]
}
```

### <a id='Overriding Defaults'></a> (Optional) Overriding Defaults

<p class="note"> For 4.4.x controllers it is mandatory to override the default Application, Tier, Tier ID and Node values.

![Settings tab for AppDynamics Default Overrides](./images/default_config.png)

* **UAA Token Endpoint**: UAA token end point of the cloudfoundry. This can be found by doing `$ cf curl /v2/info | grep token_endpoint`
* **Nozzle Application Name**: Enter a name to identify the Nozzle Application on the Controller, such as **_test-app-nozzle_**.
* **Nozzle Tier Name**: Enter a name for the Nozzle Tier that corresponds to the Nozzle Application Name, such as **_test-app-tier_**. This MUST be a Go SDK Tier.
* **Nozzle Node Name**: Enter a name for the Nozzle Node that corresponds to the Nozzle Application Name, such as **_test-app-node_**.
* **Nozzle Tier ID**: Enter the component ID of the GoLang SDK tier.

#### <a id='44x Controllers'></a> 4.4.x Controllers

For 4.4.x controller, please create an applicaiton on the AppDynamics Controller and create a `Go SDK` tier associated with that application and record the tier-id.
Enter the AppDynamics AppName, Tier, TierID and Node names in the corresponding fields of the **Overriding Defaults** form.

## <a id='validate-install'></a> Validating an Install

### <a id='Nozzle Credentials'></a> Validating the Nozzle

Once the tile install completes successfully in the Ops Manager, confirm that the Nozzle is reporting
metrics to the Controller by navigating to the appd-nozzle-v2 app and opening the Metric Browser. If
the Nozzle is successfully reporting metrics, it creates the path `Application Infrastructure
Performance|<tier>|Custom Metrics|PCF Firehose Monitor`, where the tier corresponds to the system
domain of the Pivotal Platform foundation. Navigate to a specific metric such as Diego Cell
Metrics|rep|cf|diego_cell|<guid>|rep. CapacityRemainingMemory as shown below. Doubleclick it to
add it to the time series graph and confirm metrics are reporting in the last 5 minutes.

![](./images/pcf-foundation-05.png)

If the metrics don’t appear, use the Apps Manager to tail the logs for the Nozzle `appdnozzle-
<version>` under appdynamics-org/appdynamics-space. Tailing the logs from the Apps Manager will
ensure getting the startup logs for the Nozzle, which are typically lost when using `cf logs. Follow this
procedure:

1. Set APPD_DEBUG to **true** in the Apps Manager under Settings/User Provided Environment
Variables.

    ![](./images/pcf-foundation-06.png)

    This will cause the agent logs to be forwarded to standard err rather than written to the container file
    system, so they’ll be visible in the app logs.

2. Restage the Nozzle in the Apps Manager.

3. In the Apps Manager, go to Logs and press the play button to tail the logs as the Nozzle
restages. You should see some [ERR] log messages in red that are specific to the SDK agent and
would indicate any problems communicating with the Controller. The [OUT] log messages should
show ‘Handling x events’ where x is non-zero and would indicate successful communication with the
Loggregator Firehose.

    ![](./images/pcf-foundation-07.png)

### <a id='Nozzle Credentials'></a> Validating the Dashboard App

Check that the KPI health rules have been created in the **appd-nozzle-v2** app in the Controller configured
in the tile under **Nozzle Configuration**. Navigate to Applications/appd-nozzle-v2/Alert & Respond/**Health Rules**.
You should see a set of over 100 health rules with names that are prefixed with the system domain of the Pivotal Platform foundation
where the tile was installed.

Open the the Single Foundation dashboard under **Dashboards & Reports** with the name `appd-nozzle-v2-<system domain>-PCF`
KPI Dashboard and check that there are no broken links and the widgets are showing recent data.

If any Multi-foundation dashboards were configured, check that they are also listed under Dashboards & Reports,
with the name `<config name>-PCF Multi-foundation Dashboard`.

If the health rules or dashboards are not listed, restage and check the logs for the Dashboard App `appdpcfdashboard-<version>` in
the **Apps Manager** under the org and space appdynamics-org/appdynamcis-space, as was described for the Nozzle.
Optionally set the APPD_DEBUG flag to true.

The Dashboard App requires that the Nozzle successfully publish metrics to the Controller before it will create the KPI health rules and dashboards.
If the Dashboard App does not find the metrics, it will output a message to its log:


    "retrying fetching metrics exponentially"

and eventually:

      “error: failed to find PCF metric path in target controller…”

If you see these messages, first resolve the issue with the Nozzle by following the Nozzle validation steps described above.


## <a id='Scaling'></a> AppDynamics Nozzle Scalability

Starting with the 4.6.* version of the tile, AppDynamics Nozzle is completely scalable to any number of desired instances. However,
it is recommended to scale the number of nozzle instances to match the number of traffic controller instances.
See the [official cloud foundry recommendation](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/loggregator/log-ops-guide.html#scaling-nozzles).


## <a id='deploy-multiple-tiles-on-multiple-instances'></a> Multiple Pivotal Platform Foundations

Multiple AppDynamics Platform Monitoring tiles can be deployed on multiple Pivotal Platform foundations using a single AppDynamics Controller.
The metrics corresponding to each of the foundations are recorded under tier names that default to the system domain’s value of the Cloud Foundry deployment, for example: `sys.pie-multi-az-blue.cfplatformeng.com`
Optionally, the tier names can be customized by setting the `Nozzle Tier Name` field in the **Overriding Defaults** form.
